Hi, I’m Malik (@ Malikscraft)

I’m a Shopify Store Designer & Developer focused on building fast, conversion-driven, and scalable eCommerce stores.

I work at the intersection of design, structure, and performance — helping brands fix broken Shopify setups, redesign underperforming stores, and build Shopify 2.0 systems that are easy to manage and built to sell.

- Theme customization (Liquid, layouts, sections)  
- Conversion-focused product & collection pages  
- Store performance & speed optimization  
- Shopify app integrations & automation  
- SEO-ready, mobile-first store structures  

### What you’ll find here
- Shopify theme customizations  
- Store structure & CRO documentation  
- Design systems & reusable components  
- Case studies and build breakdowns  
- Notes on performance, UX, and eCommerce systems
